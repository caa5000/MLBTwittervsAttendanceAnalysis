OVERVIEW -- This was the final project for my "Programming for Data Science" course. Use the CSV files as part of the analysis if you're trying to do it on your own.

CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive correlation between "twitter penetration in a tv market" and the % of MLB stadium fill. 

What is "twitter penetration in a tv market?" 
  The size of a TV market divided by the number of twitter followers for that respective MLB team. 
  
Why is this important/significant?
  It serves as another piece of evidence that connecting via social media is a valuable strategy in filling your MLB stadium. 
  
What are the shortcomings of this model?
  It does NOT predict, it is only meant to show the relationship. In addition, it doesn't use weighting of certain influential points which skew the slope of the line. 


PROCESS:
  Python was used for data manipulation.
  R was used for analysis.
